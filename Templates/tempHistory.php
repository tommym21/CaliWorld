        The exercises arose in the early 19th century from the work of Germans Friedrich Ludwig Jahn and Adolf Spiess in popularizing gymnastics and were especially stressed by Per Henrik Ling of Sweden as important in the development of education for women. In the United States, Catherine Beecher was an early advocate of calisthenics and wrote Physiology and Calisthenics for Schools and Families (1857). As promoted by Beecher, calisthenics were intended solely for women, but they quickly became an activity for both sexes.

        The health benefits of calisthenics were generally recognized by the beginning of the 20th century, and primary and secondary schools throughout the Western world began instituting the exercises as a regular activity. Calisthenics are also a part of military training.
